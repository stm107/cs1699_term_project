This project uses some open source java libraries (mainly jsch for connection to GCP). The dependencies are managed and built with Gradle. 

The inverted index portion (jar already on Google Cloud) was written in scala and runs on spark.

To run locally:

docker build -t inverted-index .
docker run -i -t inverted-index

(Dockerfile runs gradle build and gradle run)
